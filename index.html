The third Anglo-Afghan war which followed resulted in the kingdom of Afghanistan reclaiming its sovereignty. During his rule, Amanullah Khan and his queen pioneered radical reforms and modernization to Afghan society. Important reforms were made in the fields of education and women’s rights, and the institution of slavery was abolished. The king also began building international relations.
